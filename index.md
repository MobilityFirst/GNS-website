MobilityFirst is a Future Internet Architecture (FIA) research project. The goal of this project is to design and implement a next-generation Internet starting from a clean slate, i.e., unencumbered by concerns of interoperability with the existing Internet, but leveraging the benefit of hindsight from our experience using and studying it.

The MobilityFirst project envisions mobile and wireless devices and services as being the key driver of a next-generation Internet. The number of mobile devices already significantly exceeds the number of wired Internet-connected devices and the gap is only expected to grow. In the light of this trend, MobilityFirst focuses on two key high level design challenges: mobility and trustworthiness. "Mobility" means the ability to seamlessly support mobile and wireless devices as a norm rather than as an exception. The current Internet was designed largely with static hosts in mind as reflected by the nature of its addressing structure, name resolution service, and assumptions about end-to-end connectivity. "Trustworthiness" means that the architecture should be resilient to malicious entities seeking to compromise security or privacy. The current Internet was largely designed assuming benign users in mind, and is vulnerable to even a small number of compromised end-hosts or routers. 

This short paper on the [MobilityFirst architecture](http://www.sigcomm.org/ccr/papers/2014/July/0000000.0000011), also downloadable [here](https://www.cics.umass.edu/~arun/papers/MF-CCR.pdf), describes MobilityFirst in detail.
